# Why I Love Markdown

The debate over the best way to capture and store information has become surprisingly polarizing on the internet. Whether you’re using an iPad, a simple text file, or a modern note-taking app like Notion, everyone seems to have undying loyalty to their favorite method. In this post, I’ll explore why I have embraced markdown as my go-to digital text storage tool. 


### Handwriting Notes to Markdown

I've always been a lover of handwriting my notes with a pen and paper. It's an easy way for me to quickly get my ideas down and writing physically actually enahnces neuroplasticity. But, when circumstances require digital note taking I always opt for an experience that mirrors the ease of writing by hand. That's where markdown comes in. Amid the constant online debates around the best way to store text, markdown is my favorite. It can do anything you need for simple notes, and is essentially just a formatted text file so it is intuitive and incredibly fast to load on any computer. 


### Alternate Note-Taking Tools

Bloated note taking software has been around for a long time. I remember signing up for evernote in middle school and wondering why in the world I need to create a username and opt-out of a paid service just to take notes. Today, there are a variety of "modern" note taking tools like Notion which has tons of unnecessary fatures for most note taking tasks. Take Microsoft’s One Note, for example, which is a bloated feature-creeped note taking software that takes an eternity to load notes. That is the antithesis of what I value in a note taking tool. 

In contrast, markdown files can be opened in any plain text editor or specialized markdown viewer. These applications display files almost instantly, which gives me that feeling of flipping through a physical notebook without the any buffering or heavy software. 


### Using Markdown for my Blog

Even as a developer I decided to use markdown files as a way to store all my blog posts. Markdown files are easy to edit with any text editor, this gives me the ability to edit my blog posts locally and offline whenever I want. Once I finish my post, I can simply drop the in my website’s folder. 

I built a custom viewer for this blog using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that converts markdown to HTML directly in the browser. This approach delivers nicely formatted posts quickly and efficiently and also gives me complete control over the styling and layout. I can design my blog’s interface to be any style I want without being tied to a rigid prebuilt Content Management System. With markdown, I can also easily include code snippets, embed images, and create tables that render across devices. This once again shows how versatile markdown can be and why it is my go-to for text storage of any kind. 

By storing my blog content in markdown and handling the presentation layer separately with CSS, I maintain a clean separation of concerns. This architecture makes content management easier and allows me to update the look and feel of my blog without having to alter the underlying text. This approach embraces the simplicity, efficiency, and flexibility, of markdown. 


### Conclusion

Markdown is a universal way to store text that can be easily used to format anything from notes to full-length blog posts like this one. Just remember, if you're ever annoyed with your bloated note taking software, markdown will remain as a simple alternative you can use for all of your needs.  

But my favorite way to take notes is still pen and paper :P
