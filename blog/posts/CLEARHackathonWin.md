# CLEAR Build Week Hackathon Win


A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to participate in CLEAR's annual internal hackathon. This was a part of Build Week, the company's annual celebration of innovation and hands-on creativity where teams only had 48 hours to create prototypes that align with CLEARâ€™s mission and strategic goals. 

This year's theme was of course, AI. 

I built a machine learning tool that addresses a big problem I see today, fraud and identity risks fueled by AI-generated content. My prototype fits into CLEAR's vision of enabling trusted identity verification experiences across new industries. I led a team that worked together to help me build this idea, and after 48 hours of work, we demoed this tool to senior leadership and won first place! 

I'm really happy with the result, I always enjoy having the opportunity to build something new and useful. I'm excited to build more helpful tools like this in the future to solve real world problems and help people feel secure in an increasingly digital world.
